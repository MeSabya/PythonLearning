Metaclass create Classes and Classes creates objects.The metaclass is responsible for the generation of classes, so we can write our custom metaclasses to modify the way classes are generated by performing extra actions or injecting code.

**We can create classes using the type() function directly. It can be called in following ways â€“**

- When called with only one argument, it returns the type. We have seen it before in the above examples.
- When called with three parameters, it creates a class. Following arguments are passed to it â€“

      - Class name
      - Tuple having base classes inherited by class
      - Class Dictionary: It serves as a local namespace for the class, populated with class methods and class variables (not instance variables).

## When to use Metaclasses

ðŸ‘‰ A few cases, where we use metaclasses, are:

- As we have seen in the above example, metaclasses propagate down the inheritance hierarchies. It will affect all the subclasses as well. If we have such a situation, then we should use metaclasses.
- If we want to change class automatically, when it is created, we use metaclasses
