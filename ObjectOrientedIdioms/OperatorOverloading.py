How to add two vectors in python
'''
import itertools

class Vector(object):
    def __init__(self, vector):
        self.vector = vector
    def print(self):
        print(list(self.vector))
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(i+j for i, j in itertools.zip_longest(self.vector, other.vector))

v1 = Vector([2, 4, -1])
v2 = Vector([3, 2, 5])

v3 = v1 + v2
v3.print()
