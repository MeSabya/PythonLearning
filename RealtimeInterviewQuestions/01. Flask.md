# Flask Questions

## How Flask works

When you enter a URL into your web browser, the request is sent to the web server (like Nginx or Apache), 
which then passes it on to a WSGI server (like Gunicorn). The WSGI server is the standard interface between a web server and a Python application. 
In our case here, there's a Flask application running on the Python side of the WSGI interface.

The Flask application processes the request and generates a response, which gets sent back to the web browser via the WSGI server and web server.

Expanding the Flask application piece of this diagram, 
we'll typically have a view function (a function decorated with route(), get(), post(), delete(), etc.) that handles processing the request and generating the response:

## What is ORM in Flask
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented code instead of raw SQL.
It maps tables to classes, rows to objects, and columns to attributes.

Example (using Flask + SQLAlchemy)

```python
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80))
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True)
```

This maps to:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(80),
    email VARCHAR(120) UNIQUE
);
```
### Behind the Scenes (Staff-Level Insight)
When you do:

```python
user = User.query.filter_by(email='john@example.com').first()
```

The ORM generates:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = 'john@example.com' LIMIT 1;
```
ORMs build an expression tree under the hood and compile it into dialect-specific SQL. SQLAlchemy uses compiled query caching to optimize repeated queries.
