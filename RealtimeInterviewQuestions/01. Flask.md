When you enter a URL into your web browser, the request is sent to the web server (like Nginx or Apache), 
which then passes it on to a WSGI server (like Gunicorn). The WSGI server is the standard interface between a web server and a Python application. 
In our case here, there's a Flask application running on the Python side of the WSGI interface.

The Flask application processes the request and generates a response, which gets sent back to the web browser via the WSGI server and web server.

Expanding the Flask application piece of this diagram, 
we'll typically have a view function (a function decorated with route(), get(), post(), delete(), etc.) that handles processing the request and generating the response:
