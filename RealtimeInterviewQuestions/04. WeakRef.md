In Python, circular references and long-lived registries or caches can accidentally prevent objects from being garbage collected. This leads to:
- Memory leaks ðŸš¨
- Unnecessary resource usage

## The Problem: Strong references keep objects alive

```python
my_cache = {}
obj = SomeBigObject()

my_cache["obj"] = obj  # strong ref
del obj  # oops! object is still alive
```

## The Solution: Use weakref

```python
import weakref
my_cache = {}
obj = SomeBigObject()

my_cache["obj"] = weakref.ref(obj)
```

Now:

- If obj is no longer needed anywhere else
- It gets garbage collected
- And my_cache["obj"]() returns None

```python
import weakref
import gc

class MyObject:
    def __del__(self):
        print("Object was garbage collected")

obj = MyObject()
r = weakref.ref(obj)

print(r())  # <__main__.MyObject object at ...>

del obj
gc.collect()

print(r())  # None â€” object has been collected
```
