# Memory and Garbage Collection in Python

Python follows two kinds of strategies:
      
      Garbage Collection
      Reference counting
      

üëâ When ever a new object is created in python , python memory manager ensures that there is enough memory in the heap to allocate space to that object.

üëâ In python , all objects are derived from PyObject a struct which has two properties reference count and pointer to the object.


```python
x == 100 // this will create a new object in heap
y == 100 // this will not create a new object as an object with           value 100 is already available on heap
print(id(x) == id(y)) // this returns true because x and y are pointing to same object on heap
x = 101  // now when new value is assigned  "101" is not available on heap , 
so new object is created and x points to this new object . 
In this case value at that location is not overwritten unlike other programming languages.
```

**Example**:

```python
import sys;

print("Initial reference count of 'dheeraj' : ",sys.getrefcount("dheeraj"))
x = "dheeraj"
print("After assigning to x , references to 'dheeraj' is incremented by 1: ",sys.getrefcount("dheeraj"))
print("Address of x",id(x))
y = "dheeraj"
print("After assigning to y , references to 'dheeraj' is incremented by 1 : ",sys.getrefcount("dheeraj"))
print("Address of y", id(y))

print("Does both x and y point to same object : ",id(x) == id(y))

x = 101
print("Address of x after re-assigning : ",id(x))
print("Address of y remains same :" ,id(y)) 
print("Does both x and y point to same object : ",id(x) == id(y))
print("Final reference count of :" , sys.getrefcount("dheeraj"))

print("Current Reference count of '101' is : ", sys.getrefcount(101) , " , Address : " ,id(101))

y = 101

print("Since this object is already available on heap , this points to same object : " , id(y) == id(101) , " \n Reference count : " ,sys.getrefcount(101))
```

## Garbage Collection in Python

The job of the garbage collector is to track of the objects which can de-allocated.

Python uses below 2 algorithms for garbage collection:
      
      Reference counting
      Generational garbage collection
      
### Reference Counting
*Reference counting is a simple technique in which , whenever the reference count of an object reaches to ‚Äú0‚Äù , then it is eligible for garbage collection and the memory allocated for that object is automatically de-allocated.*

```python
import sys

print("Initial reference count of 'python' : " ,sys.getrefcount("python") )

text = "python"
print("Current reference count" , sys.getrefcount("python"))

text2 = "python"
print("Current reference count after adding one more reference" , sys.getrefcount("python"))

print(id("python") , id(text))


lst = [text]
print("Current reference count after adding one more reference by adding that object to list" , sys.getrefcount("python"))


lst = [text,text2]
print("Current reference count after adding one more reference by adding that object to list" , sys.getrefcount("python"))

print("Reference count before passing object as input to the function : ",sys.getrefcount("python"))


def temp(inp):

  print("Reference count in function :" , sys.getrefcount("python"))

temp(text)


print("Reference count after function execution : " , sys.getrefcount("python"))
```

**output of the above**

```shell
Initial reference count of 'python' :  4
Current reference count 5
Current reference count after adding one more reference 6
139892114426800 139892114426800
Current reference count after adding one more reference by adding that object to list 7
Current reference count after adding one more reference by adding that object to list 8
Reference count before passing object as input to the function :  8
Reference count in function : 10
Reference count after function execution :  8
```

üëâ ***By default python uses reference counting technique for garbage collection , which cannot be disabled (developer has no control over it).***

#### Disadvantages of Reference counting
But the issue with this technique is it has some overhead because , every object has to keep track of reference count for memory de-allocation and also memory de-allocation happens whenever an objects reference count becomes ‚Äú0‚Äù.

Reference counting will not be able to detect the cyclic references and those objects will not be eligible for garbage collection.

Because of above problems , python also uses another technique called Generational Garbage Collection.

### Generational Garbage Collection

*This says that if an object survives for a set period of time, it‚Äôs expected to survive for longer. New objects tend to turn into garbage quicker than old objects.*

Using this hypothesis, this GC monitors the young objects more frequently, since they tend to die quickly and free up more space for the computer. As for the old objects, they can be monitored less frequently. This approach speeds up performance and reduces the pause time for the application.

üëâ In generational garbage collectors, such as the one used in Java, objects are split into groups according to their age into multiple regions called generations, as shown in the diagram above. There is a Young Generation, Old Generation and Permanent Generation.

When a new object is created , that object is categorized into ‚Äúgeneration 0‚Äù or "Young Generation".

Garbage collection is triggered automatically when a generation reaches its threshold and whatever objects remain in that generation after garbage collection are promoted to older generation.
If there are 2 generations reached threshold , always garbage collection choses older generation and then younger generation.
