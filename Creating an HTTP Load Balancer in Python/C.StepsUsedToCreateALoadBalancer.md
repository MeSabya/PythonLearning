An HTTP load balancer is an HTTP proxy server that handles HTTP requests on behalf of other servers. This is what we'll be developing throughout this course. To assist in that effort, we'll be using the following tools:

- Flask is a popular Python web framework.
- pytest is a testing framework.
- venv is used for creating isolated Python environments.
- Make is an automation tool that generates executable and non-source files
- Docker is a containerization tool designed to simplify the development and deployment of applications.
- Docker Compose is to run multiple instances of a Backend.

## Commands

```shell

$ mkdir http-load-balancer
$ cd http-load-balancer
$ python3.9 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate

(env)$ python -V
Python 3.9.0

(env)$ pip install flask pytest

```
### Load Balancer which functionalities will be covered and how  

1. #### should support host and path-based routing
2. #### Load balancer should able to check health check of servers. (Health check Functionality)
3. #### Load balancer should able add firewall functionality.

   ##### Why Implement a Firewall in a Load Balancer?
  ðŸ‘‰ Since load balancers are meant for distributing traffic, why would we want to add a firewall to them ?

  Often, when an attack vector such as a DDOS attack takes place, it's not feasible to block all traffic for long periods of time since we still want to allow  
  traffic from clients not part of the attack. Since our load balancer has insights into the various parts of an HTTP request, like the headers and requested URL, 
  we can monitor exactly which clients are targeting and apply blocking rules appropriately based on behavior. So, by adding firewall capabilities to our load 
  balancer, we can block traffic in an intelligent way that's not otherwise available since Edge routers do not usually have access to HTTP requests.

  Firewall Functionality implemented using:

  - Blocking IP Addresses https://github.com/paktek123/testdriven-loadbalancer-tdd-tutorial/blob/main/loadbalancer.yaml#L16
  - Path Blocking https://github.com/paktek123/testdriven-loadbalancer-tdd-tutorial/blob/main/loadbalancer.yaml#L28


4. #### It should able to Manipulate the HTTP Request. 

  ðŸ”¯ **Why Manipulate the HTTP Request?**
  HTTP requests are made up of different parts like headers, cookies, parameters, and data, to name a few. You may want to do different things based on the values of those parts.

  **Examples:**

  ðŸ‘‰ You may want to configure your load balancer to send the client to a mobile-friendly version of your website. To do so, you can inspect the User-Agent header, determine if it's from an Android or iPhone browser, and then send it to the appropriate set of servers whilst adding additional headers.

  ðŸ‘‰ Another possible use case is to serve up localized versions of a site based on the Accept-Language header.

  - **Adding and Removing HTTP Parameters**
  https://github.com/paktek123/testdriven-loadbalancer-tdd-tutorial/blob/main/loadbalancer.yaml#L8

  - **Manipulating Cookies**
  Cookies are used to persist data on the client-side often for tracking user preferences and authentication. Adding or setting cookies can help to store vital  
  client-side information. For example, after the user sets their desired language, we can store that information on the client so that when they visit again we'll 
  know which language they prefer.

  - **Adding and Removing HTTP POST Data**
  - **Rewriting URLs**
  Rewriting URLs is common practice for many web applications. Let's say we are rolling out a new piece of functionality and we want to send 50% of our traffic to 
  the new API. Well, we can rewrite the URL randomly and send it to a particular backend server pool. In other words, perhaps when clients hit 
  https://www.website.com, a load balancer rewrites the URL to https://www.website.com/v1 and sends the request to a set of servers. Well, with the new API, we can 
  rewrite the URL to https://www.website.com/v2 for 50% of our traffic.
